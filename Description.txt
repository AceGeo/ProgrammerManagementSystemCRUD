My project ProgrammerManagementSystemCRUD is a full stack application that is built to manage programmer data stored in a MySQL database using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It allows users to create new entries of programmers, retrieve existing ones, update the details of them, and remove them as needed. The backend functionalities are implemented using the Spring Boot Framework, while the user interface is developed with React.js . Together, these technologies ensure smooth and efficient management of programmers data, making it easy for users to handle and modify information as required. 

About the part of the backend that uses the Spring Boot Framework. I have followed standard practices such as services, service implementation, DTOs, and controllers to ensure smooth operation and easy-to-understand code. Moreover, it is designed for easy future expansions, allowing the addition of new features without complications.

Also about the part of the frontend I combine the ease of Bootstrap with the reliability of the Axios library for smooth server communication. Utilizing the capabilities of React, I have created a dynamic user interface that is both functional and visually appealing.
